          Ben's Biography
        </h2>
        <p>
          He is predeceased by his parents, Benjamin Franklin Hayes and Bertha Mae
          Roberts, of North Wilksboro, North Carolina. He is survived by his wife,
          Connie Hayes, and four daughters, Lana Hayes, Laura and Allen Zellman,
          Lisa and Clark Snodgrass, and Logan Hayes. He is also survived by his
          grandchildren, Mitchell Hayes, Christian Snodgrass, Ella Snodgrass, Evan
          Snodgrass, and Ava Guthrie. Ben was a self-proclaimed hustler at a very
          early age and it all started with a just pocket knife and a goat… His
          father had given him a pocket knife, which Ben proceeded to trade for a
          goat. The goat suddenly turned on Ben, and, in a wild rage, “butted” him
          in the rear and into a fence. His father then turned to him and said,”
          Son, you’re gonna need a buyer for that goat.” And the rest, as they
          say, is history… Throughout his life Ben owned several very successful
          businesses. He was the proud owner of four truck stops and several
          different tire shops as well as a restaurant. In his later years, he was
          most notoriously known for running Ben’s Tire Sales, Inc. in Joppa, MD,
          fondly referred to as “Ben’s.” Ben’s was not just a place to get new
          tires, but also a local hangout for truck drivers and people from all
          walks of life. The shop was an extension of his own personality. Ben was
          the most welcoming and inclusive person you could ever come across. He
          was a pure force of nature and you couldn’t help but notice his
          charismatic smile and 6’4” frame when he walked through the door. If you
          had a charismatic smile yourself, and looked like a pretty lady, Ben
          would even offer you “the purdy girl discount.” He made deals on
          handshakes and would do anything to help a stranger, even if it meant
          giving them the keys to his brand new truck. Not only did Ben work hard,
          but he also thoroughly enjoyed his life. He accomplished his lifelong
          goal to travel to Hawaii. Ben was able to take his family to the Cayman
          Islands, Alaska, the Grand Canyon and the Caribbean. Ben also never left
          a casino without making a hefty deposit, but always swore he came out on
          top. He was proud that he made moonshine and grew up in the region where
          Nascar got it’s start. It was hard not to hear him coming from a mile
          away with his Dodge Hemi pick-up truck, but there were many cars he
          wished he never sold. Ben even got to cross off the biggest goal on his
          Bucket List: attending the Barrett Jackson Car Show. He was always up to
          something with one of his “Buddies.” Despite all of his adventures, Ben
          still put his family first. Ben adored all “his girls” and would never
          name a favorite, no matter how hard we tried to draw it out of him.
          However, his first girl and his best girl was his wife: Connie.
          Together, they have raised four beautiful daughters, some of which have
          raised incredible children of their own. Life lessons such as tenacity,
          intuitiveness, hard work, hustling, integrity, honesty and
          good-heartedness were taught by Ben and Connie to their children and
          they, in turn, have taught their own children these timeless virtues.
          Ben leaves behind a legacy that will not be forgotten any time soon. He
          never failed to touch the lives of those around him and leave them with
          lasting memories. His adventurous spirit and love for life was
          contagious. Ben would be proud to know that when his name is spoken, it
          would leave a smile on the faces of all who knew him. We are all blessed
          to have known him, loved him and to now have him as a guardian angel
          looking over us.
